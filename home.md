<p class="message">
  I am a fifth year PhD candidate in Statistics at <a href = "http://berkeley.edu">University of California, Berkeley</a>. I am advised by <a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~wfithian">Will Fithian</a> and <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/~pdevalpine/">Perry de Valpine</a>. 

<p>My research interests include latent variable models, computational statistics, and high-dimensional statistical methods for microbiome data. 
I am currently working with Sara Stoudt (Statistics) and Perry de Valpine on efficient maximum likelihood estimation methods for latent variables models. 
I am also working on constructing powerful and informative hypothesis testing procedures for microbiome data analysis, a joint work with William Fithian, Perry de Valpine and Ulas Karoaz (LBNL).

<p>I have completed my B.S. degree in Applied Mathematics and my B.S. degree in Statistics (Applied Statistics with emphasis on Economics) at <a href ="http://ucdavis.edu">University of California, Davis</a>.
