<p class="message">
  I am currently a data scientist at <a href="https://about.google">Google</a>.

<br>
 I received my PhD in Statistics at <a href = "http://berkeley.edu">University of California, Berkeley</a>, where I was advised by <a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~wfithian">Will Fithian</a> and <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/~pdevalpine/">Perry de Valpine</a>. 
During my PhD studies, I had interned at <a href="https://www.adobe.com/about-adobe.html">Adobe</a>, <a href="https://www.quora.com/about">Quora</a>, and <a href="https://about.facebook.com/company-info/">Facebook</a>. 
I have great interest in applying statistics for real-world problems, although coming from a math background I enjoy learning more about theoretical statistics from time to time.

<br> 
Previously I received my B.S. in Applied Mathematics and B.S. in Statistics (Applied Statistics with emphasis on Economics) at <a href ="http://ucdavis.edu">University of California, Davis</a>.
