* Machine learning techniques for price change forecast using the limit order book data (with J. Han, N. Sutardja, S.F. Wong, 2015)

**In the setting of high-frequency trading, stock price movements are fairly predictable. We use support vector machines (SVMs) with various kernels and random forests to predict the midprice movements of SPY. We find that the machine learning approach provides good prediction accuracy. This work is based on the paper "Modeling high-frequency limit order book dynamics with support vector machines" by Kercheval and Zhang.
